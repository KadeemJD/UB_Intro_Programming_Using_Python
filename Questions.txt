**QUestions**

camel case consistent and snake case consistent
or a mix of the two

I see I cant have an if if else, it only worked if it was if elif else or if if elif

parenthesis around input function for .lower() function or not

**issues I need to work on**

when im using comparison operators I have a tendency to use "is" before the ==, <= , < etc, that "is" is unnecessary.
I don't repeat the variable as often as I should
