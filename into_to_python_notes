while loop

while(True):
    entry = input(Enter number or 'x' to quit: ")
    if entry == 'x':
        break
num = float(entry)

whenever you write a program, write it piece by and piece and test it

if you want to skip a line in output you would type and additional print() function before your print function so the presentation of output is presentable
